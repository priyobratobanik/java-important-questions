Difference between static and non static variable
=================================================
in java ,static is a perticular keyword which allows a method to function without a class instance.
as,static method is a part of the class ,we dont need to create an instance.it can be accessed using classname or member name.
all the objects of a class can share a single copy of static vriables.it allocates less memory.it uses compile time binding .
ex like-bankNme,branch name,bankadress 



non static members belongs to object ,it doesnot required any special keyword.it can be accessed using objectName or member name
each object has one local copy of the non static variables.
it allocates more memory.it uses run time binding.

ex like-accountNumber,name,phone
